Terran VM implements CISC-y operators. All instructions are run in single-cycle, due to the nature of the virtual machine behind that it does high-level emulation.

The virtual machine natively supports memory allocation and variable definition, and has built-in stack memory. It has 8 general-purpose 64-bit register that works best with floating-points, and has 32-bit memory address. General-purpose registers are backed with 8-bit registers to store types of the data.

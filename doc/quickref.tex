\subsection{ABS} --- r1 \leftarrow $ |r2| $
\subsection{ADD} --- r1 \leftarrow $ r2 + r3 $
\subsection{AND} --- r1 \leftarrow $ r2 and r3 $ ; input and output are truncated and handled as if they were 32-bit integer.
\subsection{CALL} \emph{peripheral}\: Byte, \emph{arg}\: Int --- call command number \emph{arg} from \emph{peripheral}. BIOS is always mapped to \emph{peripheral} 255.
\subsection{CBRT} --- r1 \leftarrow $ r2 ^ 3 $
